The MicroPython language
========================

MicroPython aims to implement the Python 3.4 standard (with selected
features from later versions) with respect to language syntax, and most
of the features of MicroPython are identical to those described by the
"Language Reference" documentation at
`docs.python.org <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html>`_.

The MicroPython standard library is described in the
:ref:`corresponding chapter <micropython_lib>`. The :ref:`cpython_diffs`
chapter describes differences between MicroPython and CPython (which
mostly concern standard library and types, but also some language-level
features).

This chapter describes features and peculiarities of MicroPython
implementation and the best practices to use them.
