"""
DS18x20 temperature sensor driver for MicroPython.

This driver uses the OneWire driver to control DS18S20 and DS18B20
temperature sensors.  It supports multiple devices on the same 1-wire bus.

The following example assumes the ground of your DS18x20 is connected to
Y11, vcc is connected to Y9 and the data pin is connected to Y10.

>>> from pyb import Pin
>>> gnd = Pin('Y11', Pin.OUT_PP)
>>> gnd.low()
>>> vcc = Pin('Y9', Pin.OUT_PP)
>>> vcc.high()

>>> from ds18x20 import DS18X20
>>> d = DS18X20(Pin('Y10'))

Call read_temps to read all sensors:

>>> result = d.read_temps()
>>> print(result)
[20.875, 20.8125]

Call read_temp to read the temperature of a specific sensor:

>>> result = d.read_temp(d.roms[0])
>>> print(result)
20.25

If only one DS18x20 is attached to the bus, then you don't need to 
pass a ROM to read_temp:

>>> result = d.read_temp()
>>> print(result)
20.25
