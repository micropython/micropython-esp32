This directory contains network tests which require just "peer to peer"
network connection between test host and device under test, instead of
full Internet connection.

Note that setup for these tests and tests themselves are WIP, and may
not yet fully correspond to the functional specification above.

So far, these tests are not run as part of the main testsuite and need
to be run seperately (from the main test/ directory):

    ./run-tests net_hosted/*.py
